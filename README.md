As the project currently stands, I've made as close a copy of the example shown in the images (visible in "target-images) as I could.
In working on this project, I've found myself using divs more than I have in previous projects in order to manipulate page layout using Flex more efficiently. I've also found myself using classes over id's. I'm not entirely sure when it's more appropriate to use one over the other, but in all of the Odin examples they used classes consistently.
While writing the stylesheet, there was very little I found myself unsure of, and that was a nice feeling! Initially the body had something weird going on where it was leaving a margin of approx 30px before itself. I worked around it by giving it a negative margin-top value. That workaround, however, became obsolete when I changed the display of the main section to flex. If I could understand what happened there, I'd feel very happy.
As it stands, no links or buttons are functional, and that's something I'd like to change. I'd also like to personalise the website a little, and add a favicon.
