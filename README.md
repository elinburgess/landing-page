# About This Project

My first step in creating this project was to make as close a copy as I could of the example provided (visible in "target-images"). I found myself fairly confident throughout that stage. I found myself using divs more than I had in previous projects, in order to more efficiently manipulate the page layout using Flex. I've also primarily used classes, only using id's for sections on the page that I want to be able to link to in the header. I'm still not entirely sure when to use one over the other.

Links are now functional, although buttons are not. Still, they look good! I've also updated the colour palette - I tried to create my own, but failed to find a result I liked. In the end, I edited the hue, brightness, and saturation of the existing colour palette using an online tool. I thought about adding a favicon, but couldn't think of what might work, so left it blank in the end.
